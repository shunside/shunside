# Well, look who found me

Been tinkering with code for a while now (about 5 enormous years). I build stuff for web and desktop, and I can jump deep into tech when a project needs it.  

I can work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Django, Electron, Tauriâ€¦ and more if the mood strikes. Iâ€™m currently juggling a social-platform-ish project (mostly revolving around Tauri, React, TS, Django, but not limited to these) which is still under wraps (for now).  

I like keeping things simple and actually usable (mostly because I have a university life to run, but donâ€™t get me wrong, Iâ€™m always ready to dive into something more complex if itâ€™s worth it). When needed, I can get technical and make things work properly.  


## ðŸ›  My Toolbox & Skill Levels

Hereâ€™s a rough idea of what I can actually do:

- **Strong / Comfortable:** HTML, CSS, JS, TS, Python, React, Django, Tauri  
- **Medium / Working Knowledge:** Electron, Rust  
- **Light / Can read & understand:** C++, PHP, Ruby  

Basically, I can take an idea and turn it into something functional, whether itâ€™s a landing page, small tool, or full app, without panicking.  


## Rates / Vibes

I tend to keep my rates flexible and reasonable (think accessible, not flashy). Iâ€™m mostly here to build interesting things, collaborate, learn, and keep a bit of pocket money rolling in (you know, student life).

Even if itâ€™s just to bounce ideas around, get some feedback, or have a quick chat, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out. Iâ€™m here more for the projects and the ideas than the money.

About my background? Letâ€™s just say most of my learning happened outside classrooms (hints: internet, forums, YouTube, a dash of AI). Formal studies are on the horizon, so the story continues.  

Always up for chatting about tech, exchanging ideas, or figuring out ways to make stuff actually work.
